## Introduction
Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are a powerful feature in SQL Server that allows you to define temporary result sets that can be referenced within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. CTEs improve readability and maintainability of complex queries, making SQL code easier to understand and manage.

## Basic Syntax of CTE
A CTE is defined using the `WITH` keyword followed by the CTE name and the query defining the result set. You can reference the CTE within the main query as if it were a table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...)
AS
(
    -- CTE query
    SELECT ...
)
-- Main query using CTE
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;
```

## Types of CTEs

### Simple CTE
A simple CTE is a single, non-recursive query that can be used to simplify complex SQL queries by breaking them into logical parts.

### Recursive CTE
A recursive CTE references itself and is used for queries that involve hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or tree structures. It consists of an anchor member and a recursive member.

**Syntax for Recursive CTE:**
```sql
WITH cte_name (column1, column2, ...)
AS
(
    -- Anchor member
    SELECT ...
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive member
    SELECT ...
    FROM cte_name
    WHERE ...
)
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name;
```

## Use Cases for CTEs
- Simplifying complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
- Creating recursive queries for hierarchical data, such as employee-manager relationships.
- Performing operations that require multiple passes over the data, like calculating running totals or cumulative sums.
- Making the SQL code more readable and maintainable, especially in scenarios with multiple joins or nested subqueries.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple CTE
This example demonstrates the basic use of a CTE to simplify a query that selects products with a list price above a certain threshold.

```sql
WITH HighPricedProducts AS
(
    SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice
    FROM Production.Product
    WHERE ListPrice > 1000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighPricedProducts;
```

**Explanation:** The CTE `HighPricedProducts` selects products with a list price greater than 1,000, and the main query retrieves all the columns from this CTE.

### Example 2: Recursive CTE for Hierarchical Data
This example shows how to use a recursive CTE to retrieve all employees in an organizational hierarchy starting from a specific manager.

```sql
WITH EmployeeHierarchy AS
(
    -- Anchor member: Select the top-level manager
    SELECT EmployeeID, OrganizationNode, LoginID, JobTitle, 0 AS Level
    FROM HumanResources.Employee
    WHERE OrganizationLevel = 0

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive member: Select employees reporting to the current level
    SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.OrganizationNode, e.LoginID, e.JobTitle, eh.Level + 1
    FROM HumanResources.Employee e
    INNER JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.OrganizationNode.GetAncestor(1) = eh.OrganizationNode
)
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeHierarchy
ORDER BY Level, EmployeeID;
```

**Explanation:** The CTE `EmployeeHierarchy` starts with the top-level manager and recursively selects all employees reporting to each level.

### Example 3: CTE with Multiple Expressions
This example demonstrates how to define and use multiple CTEs in a single query.

```sql
WITH SalesData AS
(
    SELECT SalesPersonID, SUM(LineTotal) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
    GROUP BY SalesPersonID
),
HighSales AS
(
    SELECT SalesPersonID, TotalSales
    FROM SalesData
    WHERE TotalSales > 500000
)
SELECT *
FROM HighSales;
```

**Explanation:** The first CTE `SalesData` aggregates sales by salesperson, and the second CTE `HighSales` filters out salespeople with total sales greater than 500,000.

### Example 4: Using CTEs with INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
CTEs can also be used in conjunction with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations.

```sql
WITH TopSellingProducts AS
(
    SELECT ProductID
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
    GROUP BY ProductID
    HAVING SUM(OrderQty) > 1000
)
UPDATE Production.Product
SET ListPrice = ListPrice * 1.1
WHERE ProductID IN (SELECT ProductID FROM TopSellingProducts);
```

**Explanation:** This example updates the `ListPrice` of products that have sold more than 1,000 units, increasing the price by 10%.

### Example 5: CTE for Calculating Running Totals
This example shows how to use a CTE to calculate running totals of sales amounts.

```sql
WITH RunningTotals AS
(
    SELECT 
        SalesOrderID,
        OrderDate,
        SUM(SubTotal) OVER (ORDER BY OrderDate) AS RunningTotal
    FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
)
SELECT *
FROM RunningTotals;
```

**Explanation:** The CTE `RunningTotals` calculates the cumulative sum of sales amounts ordered by `OrderDate`.

## CTE vs Temporary Tables vs Subqueries
- **CTEs:** Ideal for readability and recursive queries. They are more straightforward for complex, nested queries and are only valid for the statement they are defined in.
- **Temporary Tables:** Useful for complex operations across multiple queries. They persist for the session and can store large intermediate results.
- **Subqueries:** Can be more concise but harder to read and maintain, especially with deep nesting. Subqueries are best for simple, one-off transformations.

## Best Practices and Limitations
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use CTEs to break down complex queries into more readable parts.
  - Utilize recursive CTEs for hierarchical data.
  - Keep CTEs focused and avoid excessive complexity within a single CTE.

- **Limitations:**
  - CTEs are only valid for the duration of the statement they are defined in.
  - Recursive CTEs can be performance-intensive, especially with deep recursion or large data sets.
  - SQL Server imposes a limit of 32767 recursions for a recursive CTE.
