## Introduction
Aggregate functions in SQL Server are used to perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. These functions are often used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to summarize data from multiple rows into a single result. This document provides a detailed explanation of each aggregate function available in SQL Server, along with practical examples using the AdventureWorks 2022 database.

## Aggregate Functions Overview

### COUNT()
The `COUNT()` function returns the number of rows that match a specified condition. It is often used to determine the number of items in a set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### SUM()
The `SUM()` function calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### AVG()
The `AVG()` function returns the average value of a numeric column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### MIN()
The `MIN()` function returns the smallest value of a selected column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### MAX()
The `MAX()` function returns the largest value of a selected column.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### GROUP BY
The `GROUP BY` clause is used to arrange identical data into groups. It is often used with aggregate functions to group the result-set by one or more columns.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name;
```

## Examples Using AdventureWorks 2022

### COUNT() Examples

1. **Count the number of employees in the organization:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
   FROM HumanResources.Employee;
   ```

   ```sql
   SELECT ProductCategoryID, COUNT(*) AS ProductCount
   FROM Production.Product
   GROUP BY ProductCategoryID;
   ```

3. **Count the number of sales orders made in 2022:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS SalesOrderCount
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
   WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2022;
   ```

4. **Count the distinct number of customers who made purchases:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS UniqueCustomers
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader;
   ```

5. **Count the number of products that have a list price greater than $1000:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS ExpensiveProducts
   FROM Production.Product
   WHERE ListPrice > 1000;
   ```

### SUM() Examples

1. **Sum the total sales amount for all orders in 2022:**

   ```

2. **Sum the total quantity ordered per product:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID, SUM(OrderQty) AS TotalQuantity
   FROM Sales.SalesOrderDetail
   GROUP BY ProductID;
   ```

3. **Sum the salaries of all employees:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalaries
   FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory;
   ```

4. **Sum the total number of hours worked by all employees:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(HoursWorked) AS TotalHours
   FROM HumanResources.EmployeeHours;
   ```

5. **Sum the total freight cost for all sales orders:**
