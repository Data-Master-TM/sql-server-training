## Introduction
SET operators in SQL Server are used to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set. The primary SET operators are `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`. This document provides detailed explanations and examples of each SET operator using the AdventureWorks 2022 database.

## Overview of SET Operators

### UNION
The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows from the result set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1
UNION
SELECT columns FROM table2;
```

### UNION ALL
The `UNION ALL` operator is similar to `UNION`, but it includes all rows, including duplicates.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT columns FROM table2;
```

### INTERSECT
The `INTERSECT` operator returns only the rows that are common to both queries.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT columns FROM table2;
```

### EXCEPT
The `EXCEPT` operator returns the rows from the first query that are not present in the second query.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT columns FROM table2;
```

## Rules for Using SET Operators
- The number of columns in the `SELECT` statements must be the same.
- The data types of the corresponding columns must be compatible.
- The column names in the result set are taken from the first `SELECT` statement.

## Examples Using AdventureWorks 2022

### UNION Examples

1. **List all product names from the `Production.Product` and `Production.ProductModel` tables:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name FROM Production.Product
   UNION
   SELECT Name FROM Production.ProductModel;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all distinct job titles from the `HumanResources.Employee` and `HumanResources.JobCandidate` tables:**
   ```sql
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.Employee
   UNION
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.JobCandidate;
   ```

3. **Get all distinct customers and employees who are also salespersons:**
   ```sql
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Sales.Customer
   UNION
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM HumanResources.Employee WHERE JobTitle = 'Sales Representative';
   ```

4. **Find all unique product IDs from two different product categories:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 1
   UNION
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 2;
   ```

5. **Combine results of sales order headers and purchase order headers by their IDs:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SalesOrderID AS OrderID FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
   UNION
   SELECT PurchaseOrderID AS OrderID FROM Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader;
   ```

### UNION ALL Examples

1. **List all product names from the `Production.Product` and `Production.ProductModel` tables, including duplicates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name FROM Production.Product
   UNION ALL
   SELECT Name FROM Production.ProductModel;
   ```

2. **Retrieve all job titles from the `HumanResources.Employee` and `HumanResources.JobCandidate` tables, including duplicates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.Employee
   UNION ALL
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.JobCandidate;
   ```

3. **Get all customers and employees who are also salespersons, including duplicate names:**
   ```sql
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Sales.Customer
   UNION ALL
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM HumanResources.Employee WHERE JobTitle = 'Sales Representative';
   ```

4. **Find all product IDs from two different product categories, including duplicates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 1
   UNION ALL
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 2;
   ```

5. **Combine all sales and purchase order headers by their IDs, including duplicates:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SalesOrderID AS OrderID FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
   UNION ALL
   SELECT PurchaseOrderID AS OrderID FROM Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader;
   ```

### INTERSECT Examples

1. **List product names that exist in both `Production.Product` and `Production.ProductModel` tables:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name FROM Production.Product
   INTERSECT
   SELECT Name FROM Production.ProductModel;
   ```

2. **Find job titles common to both the `HumanResources.Employee` and `HumanResources.JobCandidate` tables:**
   ```sql
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.Employee
   INTERSECT
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.JobCandidate;
   ```

3. **Get the names of individuals who are both customers and employees:**
   ```sql
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Sales.Customer
   INTERSECT
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM HumanResources.Employee;
   ```

4. **Retrieve product IDs common to two different product categories:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 1
   INTERSECT
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 2;
   ```

5. **Find orders that exist in both sales and purchase order headers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SalesOrderID AS OrderID FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
   INTERSECT
   SELECT PurchaseOrderID AS OrderID FROM Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader;
   ```

### EXCEPT Examples

1. **List product names that exist in `Production.Product` but not in `Production.ProductModel`:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name FROM Production.Product
   EXCEPT
   SELECT Name FROM Production.ProductModel;
   ```

2. **Find job titles in the `HumanResources.Employee` table that are not in the `HumanResources.JobCandidate` table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.Employee
   EXCEPT
   SELECT JobTitle FROM HumanResources.JobCandidate;
   ```

3. **Get customers who are not employees:**
   ```sql
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Sales.Customer
   EXCEPT
   SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM HumanResources.Employee;
   ```

4. **Retrieve product IDs that are in the first product category but not in the second:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 1
   EXCEPT
   SELECT ProductID FROM Production.Product WHERE ProductSubcategoryID = 2;
   ```

5. **Find sales order IDs that do not exist in the purchase order headers:**
   ```sql
   SELECT SalesOrderID AS OrderID FROM Sales.SalesOrderHeader
   EXCEPT
   SELECT PurchaseOrderID AS OrderID FROM Purchasing.PurchaseOrderHeader;
   ```

## Performance Considerations
- **UNION vs UNION ALL:** `UNION` performs a sort operation to remove duplicates, which can be resource-intensive. `UNION ALL` is faster because it does not remove duplicates.
- **Indexing:** Proper indexing can improve the performance of SET operations, especially when dealing with large datasets.
- **Data Types:** Ensure that the data types of the columns being combined are compatible to avoid performance degradation.
