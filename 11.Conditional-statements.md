# SQL Server Conditional Statements

## Introduction
Conditional statements in SQL Server allow you to implement logic within your queries or stored procedures. These statements enable you to execute different actions based on conditions, making your SQL scripts more dynamic and adaptable to various scenarios.

## Types of Conditional Statements

### CASE Statement
- **Description:** The `CASE` statement evaluates a list of conditions and returns one of multiple possible result expressions.
- **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    CASE
        WHEN condition1 THEN result1
        WHEN condition2 THEN result2
        ...
        ELSE resultN
    END
    ```
- **Example:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Salary,
           CASE 
               WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'High'
               WHEN Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000 THEN 'Medium'
               ELSE 'Low'
           END AS SalaryRange
    FROM Employees;
    ```
- **Result:** Categorizes employees into 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low' salary ranges.

### IF...ELSE Statement
- **Description:** The `IF...ELSE` statement is used to execute code blocks based on a condition. It is commonly used in stored procedures or scripts for control flow.
- **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    IF condition
    BEGIN
        -- Statements to execute if the condition is true
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        -- Statements to execute if the condition is false
    END
    ```
- **Example:**
    ```sql
    IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = 1)
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Department 1 has employees.'
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Department 1 has no employees.'
    END
    ```
- **Result:** Prints a message depending on whether Department 1 has employees.

### IIF() Function
- **Description:** The `IIF()` function is a shorthand way to write simple conditional logic in SQL Server. It evaluates a condition and returns one of two values.
- **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    IIF(condition, true_value, false_value)
    ```
- **Example:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Salary,
           IIF(Salary > 50000, 'High', 'Low') AS SalaryRange
    FROM Employees;
    ```
- **Result:** Labels employees as 'High' or 'Low' based on their salary.

## Use Cases

### Example 1: Using CASE for Conditional Logic
- **Scenario:** You need to categorize employees based on their salary into 'High', 'Medium', or 'Low'.
- **Solution:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Salary,
           CASE 
               WHEN Salary > 50000 THEN 'High'
               WHEN Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 50000 THEN 'Medium'
               ELSE 'Low'
           END AS SalaryRange
    FROM Employees;
    ```

### Example 2: Using IF...ELSE for Flow Control
- **Scenario:** You want to check if a department has employees and print a message accordingly.
- **Solution:**
    ```sql
    IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = 1)
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Department 1 has employees.'
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'Department 1 has no employees.'
    END
    ```

### Example 3: Using IIF() for Simple Conditions
- **Scenario:** You need a quick way to label employees' salaries as 'High' or 'Low'.
- **Solution:**
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Salary,
           IIF(Salary > 50000, 'High', 'Low') AS SalaryRange
    FROM Employees;
    ```
