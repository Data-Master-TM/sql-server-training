## Introduction
In SQL Server, JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. JOINs are essential in relational databases for retrieving data that is spread across multiple tables. This document provides a detailed explanation of the different types of JOINs available in SQL Server, along with practical examples using the AdventureWorks 2022 database.

## Types of JOINs

### INNER JOIN
An `INNER JOIN` returns records that have matching values in both tables. If there is no match between the tables, the rows are not included in the result set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)
A `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
A `RIGHT JOIN` is the opposite of a `LEFT JOIN`. It returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### FULL JOIN (FULL OUTER JOIN)
A `FULL JOIN` returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for unmatched rows on either side.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### CROSS JOIN
A `CROSS JOIN` returns the Cartesian product of the two tables. This means it returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

### SELF JOIN
A `SELF JOIN` is a regular join but the table is joined with itself. This is useful when comparing rows within the same table.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 AS A
INNER JOIN table1 AS B
ON A.column = B.column;
```

### JOIN with Multiple Tables
SQL Server allows you to join more than two tables in a single query. This is particularly useful when dealing with complex queries.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column
INNER JOIN table3 ON table2.column = table3.column;
```

## Examples Using AdventureWorks 2022
