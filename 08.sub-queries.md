## Introduction
Subqueries in SQL Server are queries nested inside a larger query. They are used to perform operations where the result of one query depends on the result of another. Subqueries can be used in various clauses such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`. This document provides detailed explanations of different types of subqueries with practical examples using the AdventureWorks 2022 database.

## Types of Subqueries

### Single-Row Subqueries
Single-row subqueries return only one row. They are typically used with comparison operators such as `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, etc.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column = (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
```

### Multiple-Row Subqueries
Multiple-row subqueries return more than one row. They are used with operators like `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`, or `SOME`.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column IN (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
```

### Correlated Subqueries
Correlated subqueries reference columns from the outer query. They are evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1 AS alias1
WHERE column operator (SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE alias2.column = alias1.column);
```

### Subqueries in the FROM Clause (Derived Tables)
Subqueries in the `FROM` clause are treated as temporary tables or derived tables. They can be used to simplify complex queries.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM (SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition) AS derived_table
WHERE condition;
```

### Subqueries in the SELECT Clause
Subqueries in the `SELECT` clause return scalar values to be used in the select list.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1,
       (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition) AS derived_column
FROM table;
```

### Subqueries in the WHERE Clause
Subqueries in the `WHERE` clause filter the result set based on the result of the subquery.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column operator (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
```

### Subqueries with EXISTS
The `EXISTS` keyword is used to test for the existence of rows in a subquery. It returns `TRUE` if the subquery returns one or more rows.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table WHERE condition);
```

### Subqueries with IN
The `IN` keyword is used to filter rows based on a list of values returned by the subquery.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column IN (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
```

### Subqueries with ANY, ALL, and SOME
The `ANY`, `ALL`, and `SOME` operators are used to compare a value to a set of values returned by the subquery.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table
WHERE column operator ANY (SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition);
```

## Examples Using AdventureWorks 2022

### Single-Row Subquery Examples

1. **Find the employee with the highest salary:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
   FROM HumanResources.Employee
   WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM HumanResources.Employee);
   ```

2. **Get the product with the lowest price:**
   ```sql
   SELECT ProductID, Name, ListPrice

   ```

4. **Find the employee who has worked in the most departments:**
   ```sql
   SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
   FROM HumanResources.Employee
   WHERE BusinessEntityID = (SELECT TOP 1 BusinessEntityID FROM HumanResources.EmployeeDepartmentHistory GROUP BY BusinessEntityID ORDER BY COUNT(DepartmentID) DESC);
   ```

5. **Get the product with the highest sales:**

   ```

5. **Get employees who have worked under multiple managers:**
