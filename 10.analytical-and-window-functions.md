## Introduction
Analytical and Window Functions in SQL Server are powerful tools for performing calculations across a set of table rows that are related to the current row. These functions are particularly useful for ranking, calculating running totals, moving averages, and other complex queries. This document provides detailed explanations and examples using the AdventureWorks 2022 database.

## Overview of Analytical and Window Functions

### ROW_NUMBER()
The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a result set, based on the specified `ORDER BY` clause.

**Syntax:**
```sql
ROW_NUMBER() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### RANK()
The `RANK()` function assigns a rank to each row within a partition of a result set, with the same rank for ties, and gaps in the ranks if there are ties.

**Syntax:**
```sql
RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### DENSE_RANK()
The `DENSE_RANK()` function is similar to `RANK()`, but it does not leave gaps in the rank sequence when there are ties.

**Syntax:**
```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### NTILE()
The `NTILE()` function divides the result set into a specified number of approximately equal groups and assigns a number to each row representing the group to which it belongs.

**Syntax:**
```sql
NTILE(n) OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### LAG()
The `LAG()` function provides access to a row at a specified physical offset that comes before the current row within the result set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
LAG(column_name, offset, default_value) OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### LEAD()
The `LEAD()` function provides access to a row at a specified physical offset that comes after the current row within the result set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
LEAD(column_name, offset, default_value) OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### FIRST_VALUE()
The `FIRST_VALUE()` function returns the first value in an ordered set of values.

**Syntax:**
```sql
FIRST_VALUE(column_name) OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### LAST_VALUE()
The `LAST_VALUE()` function returns the last value in an ordered set of values.

**Syntax:**
```sql
LAST_VALUE(column_name) OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
```

### CUME_DIST()
The `CUME_DIST()` function calculates the cumulative distribution of a value within a result set, returning a value between 0 and 1.

**Syntax:**
```sql
CUME_DIST() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

### PERCENT_RANK()
The `PERCENT_RANK()` function calculates the relative rank of a row within a partition of a result set.

**Syntax:**
```sql
PERCENT_RANK() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

## Using the OVER() Clause
The `OVER()` clause defines a window or user-specified set of rows within a query result set. It is essential for window functions, determining how rows are partitioned and ordered in the calculation.

**Syntax:**
```sql
function() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_list] ORDER BY column_list)
```

## Examples Using AdventureWorks 2022

## Performance Considerations
- **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate indexing on columns used in `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses to optimize performance.
- **Data Volume:** Analytical functions can be resource-intensive, especially with large datasets. Test performance and optimize queries as needed.
- **Window Frame Specification:** Adjust window frame specifications (e.g., `ROWS BETWEEN`) according to your requirements to control the range of data considered for calculations.
